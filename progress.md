## Current Status

### Environment
- DevContainer is ready for use
- All necessary build tools installed
- ZMQ libraries configured for UE communication
- Development user configured with proper permissions

### Communication Status
- ✅ ZMQ sockets properly connected
- ✅ UE-GNodeB bidirectional communication working
- ✅ Sample exchange operational (23040 samples/block)
- ✅ MAC-PHY interface fully integrated
- ✅ SIB1 scheduling working
- ⚠️ UE not completing attachment (missing PDSCH/PDCCH)

### Next Immediate Steps
1. **Implement PDCCH encoding** - DCI Format 1_0 for SIB1 scheduling
2. **Implement PDSCH transmission** - Transmit actual SIB1 payload
3. **Implement PRACH reception** - Handle random access preambles
4. **Complete initial access procedure** - RAR, Msg3, Msg4

### MAC Layer Status
- ✅ Basic MAC scheduler implemented
- ✅ SIB1 generation (100 bytes payload)
- ✅ CORESET#0 configuration for band 3
- ✅ SSB transmitted every 20ms
- ✅ SIB1 scheduled every 160ms
- ⚠️ PDCCH/PDSCH not yet implemented

## Technical Discoveries
- ZMQ v4.3.5 compiled from source for better compatibility
- Container configured with NET_ADMIN capability for network operations
- SCTP support included for 5G protocol requirements
- FFT index calculation for negative frequencies requires wrap-around: `(fft_size + subcarrier) as usize`
- ZMQ REP/REQ sockets may block if not properly synchronized with peer

## Known Issues
- Reference UE binaries not yet integrated (needs to be mounted or downloaded)
- Downlink processing stalls after first symbol - likely due to ZMQ REP socket waiting for request
- Need to implement continuous symbol transmission loop

  - Uses `docker exec` if running, `docker run -d` if not
  - Never rebuilds Docker image unless --rebuild-docker flag
  - Container runs in detached mode for persistence
  
- ✅ Added timestamped logging:
  - Creates log directories like `logs/2025-06-22_22-04-08/`
  - Each test run has its own isolated log directory
  - Preserves historical test results
  
- ✅ ZMQ port management:
  - Checks for processes using ports 2000/2001

  - Image name: `albor_gnb_dev:latest`
  - Volume mounted at `/workspace`
  - Test script runs entirely inside container

## Notes for Next Developer
- DevContainer is fully configured and ready to use
- Mount reference UE at /opt/reference-ue if available
- All development must happen inside the container
- Use `cargo watch` for continuous compilation during development
- Enable RUST_LOG=debug for detailed logging
- Use `./quicktest.sh` for all testing - it manages the DevContainer automatically
- Add `--rebuild-docker` flag only when Dockerfile changes are needed
- Check timestamped logs in `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/` for debugging
