# Subagent Output: MAC-PHY Integration Fix

## Summary of Actions Performed

Successfully fixed the MAC layer compilation errors and integrated the MAC layer with the PHY layer in the Albor Space 5G GNodeB implementation.

### Tasks Completed

1. **Fixed Import Issues**
   - Added missing import for `ProtocolLayer` trait in main.rs
   - Removed unused `TddPattern` import

2. **Implemented MAC-PHY Interface**
   - Created proper Arc wrapping structure for MAC layer
   - Added MAC-PHY interface to PHY layer struct
   - Implemented `set_mac_interface` method in PHY layer

3. **Updated PHY Layer Scheduling**
   - Modified downlink processing to use MAC scheduler
   - PHY now queries MAC for SSB and SIB1 scheduling information
   - Implemented fallback to frame structure if MAC unavailable

4. **Fixed Compilation Errors**
   - Corrected field name from `symbol_index` to `start_symbol` for SSB
   - Properly handled SIB1 scheduling using PDSCH time allocation
   - Fixed Arc double-wrapping issue in main.rs

5. **Verified Integration**
   - Compilation successful with only warnings (no errors)
   - MAC layer properly initialized and generates SIB1 (100 bytes)
   - MAC scheduler actively scheduling SIB1 every 16 frames
   - PHY layer successfully receiving and using MAC scheduling info

## Technical Discoveries

1. **MAC-PHY Interface Design**
   - The interface uses async trait methods for scheduling queries
   - PHY layer can operate with or without MAC (fallback mode)
   - Scheduling information includes SSB and SIB1 timing details

2. **SIB1 Scheduling**
   - SIB1 is scheduled every 16 frames in slot 2
   - Spans multiple symbols (2-5) as per PDSCH time allocation
   - 100-byte payload generated by MAC layer

3. **Arc Trait Object Pattern**
   - MAC layer wrapped in Arc for shared ownership
   - Cast to `Arc<dyn MacPhyInterface>` for trait abstraction
   - Allows PHY to call MAC methods without knowing concrete type

## Problems Encountered

1. **Missing Trait Import**: `ProtocolLayer` trait needed explicit import
2. **Field Name Mismatch**: Used wrong field names for schedule info structs
3. **Arc Wrapping Complexity**: Initially double-wrapped MAC layer causing type mismatch

## Final Task Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - All MAC-PHY integration tasks successfully completed. The MAC layer is now properly integrated with the PHY layer, with the scheduler providing timing information for SSB and SIB1 transmissions.

## Next Steps

While the MAC-PHY integration is complete, the UE still shows "Attaching UE..." indicating it's not finding the cell. This is likely because:
1. PDSCH mapping for SIB1 is not yet implemented (marked as TODO)
2. PDCCH for SIB1 scheduling is not implemented
3. Random access procedures are not implemented

These would be the next areas to focus on for full UE attachment.
