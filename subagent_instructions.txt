CRITICAL: Instructions for the Albor Space 5G GNodeB project.

MANDATORY FIRST ACTIONS:
1. IMMEDIATELY read /home/fmc/Albor_RAN_rust/GEMINI.md COMPLETELY
2. CONFIRM you understand ALL rules, especially:
   - ALWAYS ULTRATHINK before EVERY decision
   - NO placeholders, mock data, or simulated implementations
   - Check external_integrations/ before implementing
   - Sacred configs MUST NEVER be modified
   - Only test_srsran.sh and test_albor.sh allowed
   - All logs go to logs/ with timestamps

YOUR TASK: Fix Open5GS completely and test the full system end-to-end

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:
1. Kill all existing Open5GS processes and MongoDB
2. Clean up MongoDB locks and sockets
3. Setup loopback interfaces properly using scripts/open5gs/setup_loopback_interfaces.sh
4. Start MongoDB cleanly
5. Start Open5GS components in correct order using scripts
6. Verify AMF is listening on 127.0.0.4:38412
7. First test srsRAN baseline with test_srsran.sh
8. Once baseline works, test Albor gNodeB with test_albor.sh
9. Monitor for cell detection with NR parameters
10. Continue until RRC connection achieved

CONTEXT:
- We have achieved RRC connection with srsRAN using 10MHz config
- Sacred configs in config/srsran_gnb/gnb_zmq_10mhz.yml and config/srsue/ue_nr_zmq_10mhz.conf
- Open5GS uses multi-loopback (AMF on 127.0.0.4:38412)
- Latest fix added NR parameters to test_albor.sh
- This is THE FINAL PUSH to demonstrate full functionality

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Task must be FULLY complete (no placeholders)
- All tests must run with proper logging
- Write summary to /home/fmc/Albor_RAN_rust/subagent_output.md
- Document exact commands and results

REMEMBER:
- ULTRATHINK before every action
- NO shortcuts, NO exceptions
- This is THE FINAL PUSH - make it work!
