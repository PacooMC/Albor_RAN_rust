# Subagent Task Completion Summary

## Task: Create Albor gNodeB configuration and update documentation

### Completed Actions:

1. **Created Albor Configuration Directory**
   - Created `/workspace/config/albor_gnb/` directory
   - This will hold all Albor-specific configurations

2. **Copied Sacred Configuration**
   - Source: `/workspace/config/srsran_gnb/gnb_zmq_10mhz.yml`
   - Destination: `/workspace/config/albor_gnb/gnb_albor.yml`
   - Created EXACT copy of the proven working configuration
   - This configuration achieved RRC connection and is SACRED

3. **Updated CLAUDE.md - Sacred Configuration Rules**
   - Added `gnb_albor.yml` to the list of SACRED files that must never be modified
   - Added new configuration commandments:
     - Albor gNodeB MUST use gnb_albor.yml
     - We accept EXACTLY the same YAML format as srsRAN
     - Configuration is our SPECIFICATION
     - Source code adapts to configuration, NEVER the reverse

4. **Added Implementation Philosophy Section to CLAUDE.md**
   - Created new section: "ALBOR IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY"
   - Core principles documented:
     - We replicate srsRAN behavior EXACTLY
     - Configuration format compatibility is MANDATORY
     - The working configuration is our SPECIFICATION
     - Source code adapts to configuration
     - We are REPLICATING in Rust, not reinventing

5. **Updated test_albor.sh**
   - Changed from command-line arguments to configuration file approach
   - Now uses: `-c /workspace/config/albor_gnb/gnb_albor.yml`
   - Also updated to use sacred UE config: `ue_nr_zmq_10mhz.conf`
   - Ensures consistency with proven working configurations

### Key Points:

- **Configuration Sanctity**: The gnb_albor.yml is an EXACT copy of the proven working configuration
- **YAML Compatibility**: Albor must accept the same YAML format as srsRAN for seamless migration
- **Implementation Philosophy**: Code adapts to configuration, never modify the sacred configs
- **Test Integration**: test_albor.sh now uses the proper configuration files

### Result:

All tasks completed successfully. The Albor gNodeB now has its own configuration directory with the sacred configuration file, CLAUDE.md has been updated with strict rules about configuration handling and implementation philosophy, and test_albor.sh has been updated to use these configurations properly.
