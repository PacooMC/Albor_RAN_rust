# Subagent Output: Fixed MongoDB subscriber data

## Commands Executed

1. **Checked for existing subscriber:**
   ```bash
   docker exec ba328718cd9b /open5gs/misc/db/open5gs-dbctl showfiltered | grep 999700000000001
   ```
   Result: No existing subscriber found

2. **Added subscriber to MongoDB:**
   ```bash
   docker exec ba328718cd9b /open5gs/misc/db/open5gs-dbctl add 999700000000001 465B5CE8B199B49FAA5F0A2EE238A6BC E8ED289DEBA952E4283B54E88E6183CA
   ```
   Result: Successfully inserted with ObjectId('685e42c042e285ff88baa8b9')

## Verification

1. **Verified subscriber details:**
   - IMSI: 999700000000001
   - K: 465B5CE8B199B49FAA5F0A2EE238A6BC
   - OPc: E8ED289DEBA952E4283B54E88E6183CA
   - AMF: 8000 (default)
   - APN: internet
   - Slice: SST=1 (eMBB)

2. **Confirmed security parameters match UE configuration:**
   The K and OPc values in MongoDB now match exactly with those in `/config/srsue/ue_zmq.conf`

3. **MongoDB entry is properly configured for PLMN 999-70:**
   The IMSI format (999700000000001) correctly encodes:
   - MCC: 999
   - MNC: 70
   - MSIN: 0000000001

The subscriber data has been successfully added to Open5GS MongoDB. The UE should now be able to authenticate and register with the AMF.

# Subagent Output: Fixed srsRAN baseline issues

## Root Cause

After extensive investigation, I found multiple issues preventing the srsRAN baseline from working:

1. **SSB ARFCN Mismatch**: The UE was configured with SSB ARFCN 368410, but the gNodeB calculated it as 367930. This prevented the UE from finding the correct synchronization signals.

2. **Missing ZMQ Timing Advance**: The UE configuration was missing the `time_adv_nsamples` parameter required for proper ZMQ timing synchronization.

3. **Low TX Gain**: The UE TX gain was set to 50 dB while the gNodeB was at 75 dB, potentially causing PRACH detection failures.

4. **Process Stability**: The processes were crashing due to the configuration mismatches, causing the test to fail.

## Fix Applied

I made the following changes to fix the issues:

1. **Fixed SSB ARFCN in test_srsran.sh**:
   - Changed `--rat.nr.ssb_nr_arfcn 368410` to `--rat.nr.ssb_nr_arfcn 367930`
   - This ensures the UE searches for the correct SSB frequency

2. **Updated UE Configuration (config/srsue/ue_zmq.conf)**:
   - Increased TX gain from 50 to 75 dB to match gNodeB
   - Added `time_adv_nsamples = 300` for ZMQ timing synchronization

3. **Enhanced gNodeB Configuration (config/srsran_gnb/gnb_zmq.yml)**:
   - Added PRACH detection parameters:
     - `preamble_received_target_power: -100`
     - `preamble_trans_max: 7`
     - `power_ramping_step: 4`
   - Added expert PHY configuration for better PRACH detection
   - Enabled debug logging for PHY and MAC layers

## Test Results

While the fixes address the configuration issues, the test still shows:
- ✓ Open5GS AMF running (Criteria 1)
- ✓ NG setup completed (Criteria 2)  
- ✓ Connected to AMF (Criteria 3)
- ✗ Cell found but RRC connection not established (Criteria 4-6)

The UE now successfully:
- Finds the cell (PBCH CRC OK)
- Enters CAMPING state
- Sends PRACH preambles

However, the gNodeB is not detecting the PRACH transmissions. This appears to be a deeper issue with either:
- ZMQ interface timing/buffering
- PRACH detection algorithm sensitivity
- Signal power levels in the simulated environment

## Next Steps

To fully resolve the issue, consider:

1. **Verify ZMQ Connection**: Add diagnostics to confirm bidirectional data flow between gNodeB and UE through the ZMQ ports.

2. **Adjust PRACH Parameters**: Try different PRACH configuration indices or frequency offsets that might work better with the ZMQ interface.

3. **Check Signal Levels**: Implement signal level monitoring to ensure the simulated signals are within expected ranges.

4. **Review srsRAN Documentation**: Check for any known issues or specific configurations required for ZMQ-based PRACH detection.

The configuration is now correct and processes are stable, but additional work is needed to achieve full RRC connection establishment.

# Subagent Output: Found root cause of zero signal transmission

## Investigation Findings

After thorough investigation of the signal generation path from PSS/SSS generation through OFDM modulation to ZMQ transmission, I found:

1. **PSS/SSS Generation Works**: The PSS and SSS sequences are generated correctly with proper amplitude (1.413 for PSS = 3dB boost)

2. **Resource Grid Mapping Works**: PSS values are successfully mapped to the resource grid at the correct subcarriers (FFT bins 538-664)

3. **OFDM Modulation Works**: The OFDM modulator test shows it can produce non-zero output

4. **Signal Loss Point**: The first few OFDM symbols are transmitted as all zeros

## Root Cause

The issue is in the PHY downlink processing loop (`layers/src/phy/mod.rs`):

```rust
// For each symbol:
// 1. Clear resource grid for this symbol
grid.clear_symbol(symbol);

// 2. Conditionally map sync signals (only if it's an SSB symbol)
if should_send_ssb {
    // Map PSS/SSS/PBCH
}

// 3. ALWAYS modulate and send (even if nothing was mapped!)
let time_samples = ofdm_modulator.modulate(&*grid, symbol);
// Send to ZMQ...
```

**The Problem**: 
- SSBs start at symbol 2 in slot 0
- Symbols 0 and 1 are cleared but nothing is mapped to them
- These empty symbols are OFDM modulated (producing all zeros) and sent to ZMQ
- The UE receives zeros for the first symbols, which may disrupt cell detection

**Evidence from logs**:
```
Resampling: 1104 samples -> 1472 samples (0 -> 0 non-zero)
PHY->RF: Forwarding buffer #0 with 0 non-zero samples out of 1472
```

## Recommended Fix

The PHY should handle non-SSB symbols appropriately. Options:

1. **Skip transmission of empty symbols**: Only send symbols that have actual content
2. **Fill with proper signals**: Map PDCCH/PDSCH or at least reference signals to non-SSB symbols
3. **Add guard samples**: Insert low-level noise or proper 5G NR signals in empty symbols

The most correct solution is option 2 - implement proper signal mapping for all symbols according to 5G NR specifications. As a quick fix, option 1 (skip empty symbols) might help with immediate cell detection issues.

The critical code section is in `layers/src/phy/mod.rs` around lines 651-924 in the downlink processing loop.
