# Subagent Output - 5G SA Test Results

## Date: 2025-06-24
## Task: Test complete 5G SA setup with srsRAN gNodeB and UE

## Summary

I attempted to test the complete 5G SA setup but encountered several challenges that prevented successful completion.

## Actions Performed

1. **Docker Container Setup**
   - Started development container `albor-gnb-dev` with privileged mode for network interface creation
   - Successfully created loopback interfaces (lo2-lo20) for network isolation
   - Each component assigned unique IP: MongoDB (127.0.0.2), AMF (127.0.0.4), UPF (127.0.0.10), gNodeB (127.0.0.11)

2. **Open5GS Status**
   - Found existing Open5GS container (`albor-gnb-dev-open5gs-test`) already running
   - MongoDB running on 127.0.0.2:27017
   - All Open5GS services (NRF, AMF, SMF, UPF, etc.) are running as processes
   - However, AMF is NOT listening on NGAP port 38412 (SCTP)

3. **Test Attempts**
   - Attempted to run test_5g_final.sh but MongoDB not installed in dev container
   - Tried test_5g_sa_loopback.sh but requires Open5GS binaries in dev container
   - Created shared network namespace between containers for connectivity

## Technical Discoveries

### Critical Issue: AMF NGAP Port Not Listening
- AMF process is running: `/opt/open5gs/bin/open5gs-amfd -c /workspace/config/open5gs_native/config/amf_fixed.yaml -D`
- AMF SBI interface listening on 127.0.0.4:7777 (HTTP/2)
- **AMF NGAP interface NOT listening on 127.0.0.4:38412 (SCTP)**
- This prevents gNodeB from establishing N2 connection

### Possible Causes:
1. **SCTP Module**: Docker container may lack SCTP kernel module support
2. **Container Privileges**: Even with --privileged, SCTP binding may be restricted
3. **Configuration Issue**: AMF config shows ngap server on 127.0.0.4 but may have binding issues

### Network Configuration Status:
- ✅ Loopback interfaces created successfully
- ✅ MongoDB running on 127.0.0.2
- ✅ Open5GS services running
- ❌ AMF NGAP port 38412 not accessible
- ❌ Cannot establish gNodeB to AMF connection

## Problems Encountered

1. **Container Architecture Mismatch**
   - Open5GS runs in separate container with MongoDB
   - Development container lacks Open5GS binaries
   - Test scripts expect single container with all components

2. **SCTP Binding Issue**
   - AMF cannot bind to SCTP port 38412
   - Likely due to Docker SCTP limitations
   - May require host network mode or special kernel modules

3. **Process Permission Issues**
   - Cannot restart AMF process (zombie processes)
   - Container init system prevents proper process management

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Solution**: 
   - Use Docker host network mode: `--network host`
   - Or run Open5GS directly on host system
   - Or use Docker Compose with proper SCTP support

2. **Container Restructure**:
   - Create unified container with Open5GS + srsRAN
   - Or use Docker Compose to properly orchestrate services
   - Ensure SCTP kernel module loaded on host

3. **Alternative Test Approach**:
   - Test with TCP-based N2 interface (if supported)
   - Or run AMF on host and gNodeB in container
   - Or use VMs instead of containers for full network stack

## Next Steps

To achieve successful 5G SA registration:
1. Resolve SCTP binding issue for AMF
2. Ensure gNodeB can connect to AMF on port 38412
3. Then proceed with UE registration testing

## Final Status: **INCOMPLETE** - Blocked by AMF SCTP binding issue

The loopback network isolation is correctly configured, but the core issue is that AMF cannot bind to the SCTP port required for N2 interface, preventing any gNodeB connection attempts.
